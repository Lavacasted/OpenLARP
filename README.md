# PolicyRemover
Project to temporarily stop restriction software on school-based computers.

## Introduction

PolicyRemover is a project started by me (Lavacasted) due to the high influx of students pouring into my DMs asking me "How to bypass management applications on my Windows computer?"

So I created PolicyRemover

## How the fuck do I use this?

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Lavacasted/PolicyRemover/releases)
2. Run the file **with administrative privileges**
3. Choose your option
4. Profit

## Features I added, or want to add

Oh yeah, I finally added some actually good code that removes your chrome policies. (Requires administrative privs)
